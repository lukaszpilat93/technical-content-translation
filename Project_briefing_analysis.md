PROJECT BRIEFING ANALYSIS
===============
Now that you know the right tone of voice and the basics of Trados, it is time for the next step. Every project handout contains the so called **project briefing** you can find on the F://drive
The most important thing is the difference between the following workflows:

* Translation only
* Translation + editing
* Translation + editing + proofreading

**Translation only**

This is the most basic workflow our client orders for non-customer facing outputs, such as e.g. internal guidelines. Since it is ONLY YOU who will work on the project, please check all the segments (called matches) as well as repetitions and context matches. The final step is to perform a quality assurance task explained later. Afterwards, you are expected to forward the delivery to our final client. For more information about the various file types, please go to the chapter [File types - what can you expect](File_types_what_can_you_expect.md).

**Translation + editing**

This process consists of two basic steps:

Translation: This is the initial phase where you translate the content, as per usual requirements you can see in the chapter  [File types - what can you expect](File_types_what_can_you_expect.md).

Editing: Once the translation is complete, the text goes to an editor. You will get a hint about your editor and the way of submitting your work to them.

**Translation + editing + proofreading**

The translation + editing + proofreading process has three essential stages:

Translation: This is the initial phase where you translate the content, as per usual requirements you can see in the chapter  [File types - what can you expect](File_types_what_can_you_expect.md).

Editing: Once the translation is complete, the text goes to an editor. You will get a hint about your editor and the way of submitting your work to them.

Proofreading: After editing, the proofreader checks the text for any remaining errors or typos.
It is also **their** duty to submit the completed project to the final client.

Irrespective of the project workflow, please always maintain the highest quality standard and do not forget to run xBench on the translated files. Some detailed instructions on how to do this will be provided in the subsequent sections of this manual.

 > Always rememver that any delays on your side may severely impede the whole project, so make sure to inform your project manager of them **in due time**!
